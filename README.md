### SiteFusion Application Server

SiteFusion is a server-based development environment. Applications are written in pure object-oriented PHP and work through a thin XUL client. SiteFusion applications look and behave like native system applications but run on a server generating JavaScript commands.


### Features

 * Platform-independent applications
 * OS-native look and feel
 * Writing applications in pure object-oriented PHP
 * No traditional browser security restrictions: access the client filesystem and run programs
 * It's Fast!
 * API that offers the full set of possibilities that XUL and PHP entail
 * Aimed at quick, efficient programming by minimizing the amount of code needed
 * Client connecting through a regular webserver, no additional configuration required
 * Thin, update-free, fully brandable and customizable XUL client
 * XULCustomTree, the adapted tree class that unlocks all features of the Mozilla tree view including sorting, drag & drop and editable cells. Also supports sparse trees, allowing efficient presentation and operation of trees of over 10000 nodes.
 * Continuous processes on the server side governed by a daemon
 * Two-way real-time ZLib compressed communication
 * No exposure of application logic and code
 * Possibility to easily integrate all kinds of JavaScript or XPCOM platform-dependent binary components into the client and operate them from the server
 * Silently pushing these client extensions from the server, without user interaction. This enables the client to effectively transform into any form required by the application.
 * Jobs, cronjob-like timed execution of a PHP script and mailing of the output to a specified address
 * Services, separate processes facilitating certain features to other processes
 * And last but not least: the technology has proven itself in a real-time, demanding business environment for over 5 years.
